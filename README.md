# A unique social network: Connecting people through films and series
----

## Criteria A: Planning
### Problem definition
Films and series are a huge part of our life, especially in an era where common cable tv structure has moved to online distribution networks such as HBO GO, disney+ and Netflix. Despite the expansion that the visual entertainment industry has undergone, there is still a big problem. 

There are over 200 streaming platforms but none of them has a space where users can interact with each other through the movies they love, encouraging alienation and an individualistic culture for young people. This problem highlights the need for social networks dedicated to fostering connections and communities between users based on their favorite films and series. 

### Rationale for proposed solution
With this problem in mind an suitable solution for this problem is a unique social network where users can post and comment under theand mess

### Design statement
I will create a film social network for building connections and creating interactions between users based on their favorite films. The network will allow users to upload new titles, post their thoughts about those titles on their profile and comment on others posts. The social network will be created using python 3.8, flask, html, css and SQLite (database). It will take around 4 weeks to complete based on the success criteria.
