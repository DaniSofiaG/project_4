# A unique social network: Connecting people through films and series
----

## Criteria A: Planning
### Problem definition
Films and series are a huge part of our life, especially in an era where common cable tv structure has moved to online distribution networks such as HBO GO, disney+ and Netflix. Despite the expansion that the visual entertainment industry has undergone, there is still a big problem. 

There are over 200 streaming platforms but none of them has a space where users can interact with each other through the movies they love, encouraging alienation and an individualistic culture for young people. This problem highlights the need for social networks dedicated to fostering connections and communities between users based on their favorite films and series. 

### Rationale for proposed solution
Based on this problem, an adequate solution would be a specialized platform where people can communicate with each other through a shared interest in movies and series. The proposed network will allow users to interact with each other by uploading new titles, posting their thoughts on their profiles, and commenting on other usersâ€™ posts. To develop this website based network I will be using Python 3.8, Flask, HTML, CSS and SQLite. [1]Python is versatile and highly efficient, having its own unit testing makes the process of coding a lot more efficient and its access to params such as flasks makes it ideal for web development. [2]Flask is a framework to build web applications, it is simple and flexible using modular programming to keep the program lightweight and coherent. [3]HTML is the best option for the development of this solution because it's supported by an extensive range of  browsers, meaning that it allows a wider connection between users. [4]CSS will be used to design the website because in terms of design it has a wider range of formatting options and uses substantially less code, making the webpage less dense for browsers to support it. In order for the network to work properly the data provided by users must be stored, for this creating a database with a series of tables is a great option. [5]SQLite does not need to read entire files, instead it reads and stores the necessary data, making it a great option for this website. 

### Design statement
I will create a film social network for building connections and creating interactions between users based on their favorite films. The network will allow users to upload new titles, post their thoughts about those titles on their profile and comment on others posts. The social network will be created using python 3.8, flask, html, css and SQLite (database). It will take around 4 weeks to complete based on the success criteria.

### Success criteria

1. The website has a secure registration system page with a password and email policy.
2. The website is developed using HTML and CSS.
3. The website has a login page where the user can log in to the network by using the information they previously registered.
4. The website has a page for each user to have their own profiles, where their posts are displayed
5. The website only allows users to post on their own profile.
6. The website allows commenting (not posting) on others' posts. 
7.The website has a home page that introduces the concept of the network.
