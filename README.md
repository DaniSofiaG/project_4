# A unique social network: Connecting people through films and series
----

## Criteria A: Planning
### Problem definition
My client is a films and series enthusiast, who spends most of their time consuming this type of media. She has noticed that many people around her do the same thing, thus spend most of their time without interacting with other people and struggle developing their social skills. There are over 200 streaming platforms but none of them has a space where users can directly interact with each other through the movies they love or create conversation by replying to each other's thoughts, promoting  alienation and an individualistic culture for young people. The client has noticed that a lot of people try to build interactions through internet forums, but this has proven to be counterproductive since the pages tend to be disorganized, people cant keep track of their posts and it's difficult to create direct interactions between users with such a large forum where all users post on the same page, making all interactions simultaneous and overwhelming. The client also doesn’t feel like most public forums make a good job protecting her personal data. 

### Rationale for proposed solution
Based on this problem, an adequate solution would be a specialized platform where people can communicate with each other through a shared interest in movies and series. The proposed network will allow users to interact with each other by uploading new titles, posting their thoughts on their profiles, and commenting on other users’ posts. To develop this website based network I will be using Python 3.8, Flask, HTML, CSS and SQLite. [1]Python is versatile and highly efficient, having its own unit testing makes the process of coding a lot more efficient and its access to params such as flasks makes it ideal for web development. [2]Flask is a framework to build web applications, it is simple and flexible using modular programming to keep the program lightweight and coherent. [3]HTML is the best option for the development of this solution because it's supported by an extensive range of  browsers, meaning that it allows a wider connection between users. [4]CSS will be used to design the website because in terms of design it has a wider range of formatting options and uses substantially less code, making the webpage less dense for browsers to support it. In order for the network to work properly the data provided by users must be stored, for this creating a database with a series of tables is a great option. [5]SQLite does not need to read entire files, instead it reads and stores the necessary data, making it a great option for this website. 

### Design statement
I will create a film social network for building connections and creating interactions between users based on their favorite films. The network will allow users to upload new titles, post their thoughts about those titles on their profile and comment on others posts. The social network will be created using python 3.8, flask, html, css and SQLite (database). It will take around 4 weeks to complete based on the success criteria.

### Success criteria

1. ```[issue: The client also doesn’t feel like most public forums make a good job protecting her personal data]``` The website has a secure registration system page with a password and email policy. The website has a login page where the user can log in to the network by using the information they previously registered.

2. ```[issue: difficult to create direct interactions between users with such a large forum where all users post on the same page]``` The website has a page for each user's profile, where their posts are displayed.

3. ```[issue: this has proven to be counterproductive since the pages tend to be disorganized]``` The website has a layout that makes organization simple and easy to understand for the users. 

4. ```[issue: people can't keep track of their posts]``` The website displays all users' posts on their profile.

5. ```[issue: none of them has a space where users can directly interact with each other through the movies they love or create conversation by replying to each other's thoughts]``` The website allows commenting (not posting) on others' posts.
